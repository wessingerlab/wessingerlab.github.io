<!--hello, this is an html comment--> 
<!--the title here NORMALLY controls the big text at the top of this web page as well as the title shown within the tab but I changed that so this title only controls the text within the tab for all .Rmds/.htmls (the change is coded within the in_header.html) because I wanted the information in the tab to say something different than the text at the top of each web page-->

<!-- the html object formatted above (still in the language css) sets the background image used for this webpage 
#IMP the image is dynamically scaling when set this way meaning it's size and what is show changes when you change your browser/screen size
the url() command tells the computer where this image is currently located compared to the director the rproj is in so it's in a folder called images and the image itself is called virgatus_new.jpg
#IMP 2: the only issue with using this css background style image is that you cannot add informative captions to them, this is bc css is meant to be used purely for aesthetics, not for conveying information
background-position: center; just centers the image vertically and horizontally within the screen
background-repeat: no-repeat; means if the screen is too big that the image can't take up the whole thing, don't repeat the image
background-size: cover is what makes this image cover the entire width of the screen
background-attachment: fixed; is kind of complicated but means that is there is enough text that the screen needs to scroll, keep the image fixed in it's place aka don't scroll with the text -->

<!-- body { -->
<!--    color: black; -->
<!--    position: absolute;  -->
<!--    top: 200px;  -->
<!--    left: 0;  -->
<!--    width: 100%;  -->
<!--    background: rgba(211, 211, 211, .7); -->
<!-- } -->

<!--the body object formatted above (still in the language css) sets the style for the "body" aka the actual text within this web page
#IMP: this body is set here because it is different than the way we generally want the body formatted in the other pages, if it was something that we wanted on all of the pages then we would set it within the style.css
color: sets the color of the text
position: absolute sets the position to be the same relative to the scaling of it's containing block aka relative to the position of other things contained within the page (like images)
top: 200 px means the body will start 200 pixels down from the top of the screen (again regardless of width or other things contained withing this page as discussed above)
left: 0 means the body will start 0 pixels from the left of the screen (again regardless of width or other things contained withing this page as discussed above)
width: 100% sets the width of the body to cover 100% of the width of the screen
background: rgba(211, 211, 211, .7); sets the background of the body to be a light grey (hex code 211, 211, 211) with an alpha (transparency) value of .7 (70% opaque) -->

<!-- this block changes the settings that were discussed above to be different if the screen size is smaller than 480 pixels in width aka on phones/ipads because the formatting as it was looked super bad on phones before

you can check what this looks like after knitting this web page by narrowing your screen until it shifts into the different formatting

the html object is formatted to be largely the same as the default for bigger screens that was discussed above, one difference is the image that it uses (virgatus_thin.jpg) is a cropped version of the original image because it looks nicer to have a skinnier image here

the body formatting here is also largerly the same except there is a smaller distance from the top of the screen (100 px instead of 200px) -->

<!-- below is the actual body of the text, aka what is getting formatted in the css body{} above -->

# The Wessinger Lab -- Plant Evolutionary Genetics 
<!-- Wessinger Lab is text that is in the header 1 format (styled to have a certain font size and to be centered within the style.css) which is the largest header and is always called in rmd by a single hastag (unlike normal R where hashtags are comments, hashtags always represent the size of the header in rmd, so ## is header 2 the second biggest header and ### is header 3 which is third biggest... etc.)--> 

<p> 

The Wessinger lab is located at the [University of South Carolina Department of Biological Sciences](https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/biological_sciences/our_people/directory/wessinger_carolyn.php). We are a collaborative group of researchers studying population genetic processes contributing to adaptive evolution. Our primary study system is Penstemon, an emerging model system for studying convergent / parallel evolution. We are committed to building a welcoming and supportive environment for all researchers.</p>


<!-- the text above is all normal body text which is styled first by the css formatting contained within this web page as discussed above (currently formats placement, background color) and second by the formatting contained in the style.css (currently formats font type and font size)-->
