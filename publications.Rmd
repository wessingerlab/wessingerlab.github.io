<!--hello, this is an html comment--> 
<!--the title here NORMALLY controls the big text at the top of this webpage as well as the title shown within the tab but I changed that so this title only controls the text within the tab for all .Rmds/.htmls (the change is coded within the in_header.html) because I wanted the information in the tab to say something different than the text at the top of each webpage--> 
<br>
<!-- anything within carrots is html code that will by knitted into the .html output my knitting the .rmd-->
<!-- br means break and inserts an empty line, i think the size of the break is based on the default size of the body text-->

<!-- header 1, aka the large font that is centered at the top of the webpage, best to leave a line between headers and other code, otherwise sometimes rmd won't format them correctly -->


<!--the code below indicates this is a code block containing code (within the ```) in the language css and we don't want this code to be echoed onto the website (echo=F)-->

<!-- the html object formatted above (still in the language css) sets the background image used for this webpage 
#IMP the image is dynamically scaling when set this way meaning it's size and what is show changes when you change your browser/screen size
the url() command tells the computer where this image is currently located compared to the director the rproj is in so it's in a folder called images and the image itself is called virgatus_new.jpg
background-size: 50%; is what makes this image cover the half of the width of the screen
height: 100%; ensure the image takes up 100% of the screen hieght
background-position: left center; centers the image vertically and moves it to the left horizontally
background-repeat: no-repeat; means if the screen is too big that the image can't take up the whole thing, don't repeat the image

<!-- body { -->

<!--the body object formatted above (still in the language css) sets the style for the "body" aka the actual text within this webpage
#IMP: this body is set here because it is different than the way we generally want the body formatted in the other pages, if it was something that we wanted on all of the pages then we would set it witin the style.css
color: sets the color of the text
position: fixed sets the position to be the same regardless of screen width and the position of other things contained within the page (like images)
right: 0  and bottom: 0 means the body will start 0 pixels from the right and bottom of the screen (again regardless of width or other things contained withing this page as discussed above) aka will be right justified
top: 20 px means the body will start 20 pixels down from the top of the screen (again regardless of width or other things contained withing this page as discussed above)
width: 50% sets the width of the body to cover half of the width of the screen-->

<!-- @media screen and (max-width: 480px): this block changes the settings that were discussed above to be different if the screen size is smaller than 480 pixels in width aka on phones/ipads because the formatting as it was looked super bad on phones before

you can check what this looks like after knitting this webpage by narrowing your screen until it shifts into the different formattng

the html{} object is formatted to be different than  the default for bigger screens that was discussed above, because having an image take up half of a small screen is not very readable SO:
<!-- the html object formatted above (still in the language css) sets the background image used for this webpage

background-position: center; just centers the image vertically and horizontally within the screen
background-repeat: no-repeat; means if the screen is too big that the image can't take up the whole thing, don't repeat the image
background-size: cover is what makes this image cover the entire width of the screen
background-attachment: fixed; is kind of complicated but means that is there is enough text that the screen needs to scroll, keep the image fixed in it's place aka don't scroll with the text -->

background: rgba(211, 211, 211, .7); sets the backgrund of the body to be a light grey (hex code 211, 211, 211) with an alpha (transparency) value of .5 (50% opaque) -->
