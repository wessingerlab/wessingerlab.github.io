<!--hello, this is an html comment--> 
<!--the title here NORMALLY controls the big text at the top of this web page as well as the title shown within the tab but I changed that so this title only controls the text within the tab for all .Rmds/.htmls (the change is coded within the in_header.html) because I wanted the information in the tab to say something different than the text at the top of each web page-->

<!-- anything within carrots is html code that will by knitted into the .html output my knitting the .rmd-->
<!-- br means break and inserts an empty line, i think the size of the break is based on the default size of the body text-->

## We are recruiting two postdocs to the lab, thanks to funding from NSF and NIH MIRA !

These postdocs will lead projects investigating the following types of questions:
*What is the contribution of introgression to patterns of parallel trait evolution and speciation?
*What is the genetic and genomic architecture for adaptive evolution?
*How is complex trait variation maintained in recently diverged species?
*What components of parallel evolution occur through similar genetic changes?

Expertise in phylogenomic analyses, population genetics, quantitative genetics, and fieldwork are a plus!

Start dates are flexible and salaries will be competitive.

Please email Carrie with a statement of interest! Thanks!!
