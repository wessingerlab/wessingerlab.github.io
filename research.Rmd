<!--hello, this is an html comment--> 
<!--the title here NORMALLY controls the big text at the top of this webpage as well as the title shown within the tab but I changed that so this title only controls the text within the tab for all .Rmds/.htmls (the change is coded within the in_header.html) because I wanted the information in the tab to say something different than the text at the top of each webpage-->

<!-- anything within carrots is html code that will by knitted into the .html output my knitting the .rmd-->
<!-- br means break and inserts an empty line, i think the size of the break is based on the default size of the body text-->


<!--the code below indicates this is a code block containing code (within the ```) in the language css and we don't want this code to be echoed onto the website (echo=F)-->
<!--note: no coments can be made within the code block bc rmd is weird so all comments will be below the block and will occur below a comment out version of the thing excatly as it appears within the block,--> 
```{css, echo=FALSE}

  display: table-caption;
  text-align: left;
  font-size: 14px;
  padding: 10px;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  table{
    width: 100%;
    position: center;
  }

<!-- caption { -->
<!--   display: table-caption; -->
<!--   text-align: left; -->
<!--   font-size: 14px; -->
<!--   padding: 10px; -->
<!-- } -->

<!-- the caption object formatted above (still in the language css) sets the style for the "captions" aka the image+caption pairs within this webpage
display: table-caption; sets the display of any object called with the tag "caption" to be a table and a caption (the table is where we will insert the image)
text-align: left; left aligns the text within any caption
font-size: 14px; sets the font of the text within the image captions
left: 0 means the body will start 0 pixels from the left of the screen (again regardless of width or other things contained withing this page as discussed above)
padding: 10px; sets the padding to be 10px around the entire caption object (the text AND the image) -->


<!-- @media screen and (max-width: 480px) { -->
<!--   table{ -->
<!--     width: 100%; -->
<!--     position: center; -->
<!--   } -->
<!-- } -->

<!-- the table object formatted above (still in the language css) sets the style for the "table" aka the image+caption pairs within this webpage when the webpage is smaller than 480 pixels (aka a phone or ipad screen)
width: 100%; sets the entire object (image+caption) to take up 100% of the screen, ensures tha the texts isn't weirdly wrapping these images
position: center; centers the entire object (image+caption) on the screen, BUT doesn't center the image contained witgin the table itself.... a problem that I am currently working on -->


# Current Research
<!-- header 1, aka the large font that is centered at the top of the webpage, best to leave a line between headers and other code, otherwise sometimes rmd won't format them correctly -->

Our research investigates how genetic and ecological processes at the population level contribute to larger patterns and trends in complex trait evolution, specifically parallel evolution. Currently we are exploring these issues in *Penstemon*, an emerging model system for floral evolution.

<!-- inserts a caption that is attached to the table inserted above (as styled by the caption tag set in css above) and aligns that caption to the bottom of the table (aka image) (the ** around a word still make the word italicised)

<!-- <tr><td><img src="images/neomex.barbatus.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="300" style="padding: 10px"></td></tr> -->
<!-- the tr tag means this line represents a row in the table and the td tag means this is a "daughter cell" of the table, basically these tags just say in html that this image is meant to be inserted into the table
the <img is html that calls the container "img" (styled above in css) and fills it with the image linked within the src="path/to/img/from/rproj/dir and formats it to be aligned in a certain way, have a specific hieght and width (in pixels) and a specific amount of padding

<!--  this tells the html that this is where the table object, (opened at the start with "<table" ends) -->

*Penstemon* is a large North American plant genus that is ancestrally adapted to bee pollination. Flowers adapted to hummingbird pollination have repeatedly evolved (an estimated 15-20 times!) through complex change to multiple floral traits, with little evidence of evolutionary reversals back to bee syndrome. Recent macroevolutionary analyses suggest hummingbird syndrome is associated with reduced diversification rate within *Penstemon*.

This impressive parallel evolution in a complex trait makes *Penstemon* a fantastic comparative system to study a variety of questions above and below the species level. We study these questions using a variety of approaches: population genomics, QTL mapping, quantitative genetics, comparative studies, phylogenetics, and modeling approaches.

### **What is the source of genetic variation for repeated evolution in a complex trait?**
<!--h3 header, 3rd biggest, size set in style.css, this is bolded as indicated by the ** ** around the words -->

<table class="image" align="left">
<caption align="bottom">An ancestral character reconstruction. Blue: bee syndrome Red: hummingbird syndrome.</caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/crownML.B1.asr.jpg" align="left" width="225" height="225" style="padding: 10px"></td></tr>
</table>

<!-- image +caption being set as discussed above -->

Our best estimate of the species tree suggests hummingbird syndrome has evolved many independent times. Perhaps this makes this trait highly genetically "accessible" in *Penstemon*. 

What are the relative roles of *de novo* mutations, introgression, and/or ancestral polymorphism in the repeated evolution of hummingbird syndrome traits?

Data from an initial cross suggest relatively few QTLs of major effect underlie the evolution of hummingbird syndrome in this case. Are the genetic architectures and/or QTL positions similar across independent origins of hummingbird adaptation?

### **Effects of trait evolution on mating system and vice versa**

Recent modeling work suggests that reproductive features of populations can influence pollinator transitions. Specifically, the capacity for delayed selfing broadens the conditions where transitioning to a new pollinator such as hummingbirds is favored. This predicts transitions to hummingbird pollination may occur more frequently in self-compatible lineages. 

<table class="image" align="center">
<caption align="bottom">Closely related species *P. hirsutus* (left) and *P. smallii* (right) exhibit large floral trait differences. </caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/hirsutus.smallii.jpg" align="center" width="500" height="225" style="padding: 10px"></td></tr>
</table>
 
On the flip side, does pollination by hummingbirds vs. bees impact mating system in terms of mate diversity and frequency of self-fertilization? This would affect the structure of genetic diversity within populations and may be relevant for macroevolutionary dynamics.
