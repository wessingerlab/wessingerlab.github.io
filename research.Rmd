<!--the title here NORMALLY controls the big text at the top of this web page as well as the title shown within the tab but I changed that so this title only controls the text within the tab for all .Rmds/.htmls (the change is coded within the in_header.html) because I wanted the information in the tab to say something different than the text at the top of each web page-->

position: center; centers the entire object (image+caption) on the screen, BUT doesn't center the image contained within the table itself.... a problem that I am currently working on -->

#### ***How do complex adaptations rapidly - and repeatedly - evolve during species radiations?***

We seek to understand how genetic and ecological processes generate and maintain trait diversity. We are primarily exploring these issues in *Penstemon*, an enigmatic comparative system for studying complex trait evolution. Our work developing *Penstemon* as a model for evolutionary genetics is collaborative with [Lena Hileman](http://www.hilemanlab.org/), [John Kelly](https://eeb.ku.edu/john-kelly), [Mark Rausher](http://people.duke.edu/~mrausher/), and [Kate Ostevik](https://www.osteviklab.com/).

### **Exceptional convergent evolution in *Penstemon* **

<!-- body text about the general research of the lab (size set in style.css), the * * around a word make the word italicized-->

<table class="image" align="right">
<caption align="bottom">Top: Bee-adapted species. Bottom: hummingbird-adapted species.</caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/neomex.barbatus.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="300" style="padding: 10px"></td></tr>
</table>

<!-- <table class="image" align="right"> -->
<!-- inserts a table of class image and aligns that table to the right (formatting corresponds to the table tag set in css above, although currently only set for when the screen size is small)-->

<!-- <caption align="bottom">Top picture: *P. neomexicanus*, bee syndrome. Bottom pucture: *P. barbatus*, hummingbird syndrome.</caption> -->
<!-- inserts a caption that is attached to the table inserted above (as styled by the caption tag set in css above) and aligns that caption to the bottom of the table (aka image) (the ** around a word still make the word italicized)
the </caption> tells html that is where the caption ends -->

<!-- <tr><td><img src="images/neomex.barbatus.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="300" style="padding: 10px"></td></tr> -->
<!-- the tr tag means this line represents a row in the table and the td tag means this is a "daughter cell" of the table, basically these tags just say in html that this image is meant to be inserted into the table
the <img is html that calls the container "img" (styled above in css) and fills it with the image linked within the src="path/to/img/from/rproj/dir and formats it to be aligned in a certain way, have a specific height and width (in pixels) and a specific amount of padding

</table>
<!--  this tells the html that this is where the table object, (opened at the start with "<table" ends) -->

In the North American wildflower genus *Penstemon*, evolutionary transitions from bee to hummingbird pollination have occurred in an estimated 20+ lineages through changes to a complex of floral traits. Recent macroevolutionary analyses suggest that transitions to hummingbird pollination are associated with reduced speciation rates and that reversals back to bee pollination are rare.

We view *Penstemon* as an exceptional comparative system to study fundamental evolutionary genetics questions, using approaches such as population genomics, quantitative genetics, comparative studies, phylogenomics, and modeling.

### **What is the source of genetic variation for widespread convergent evolution?**
<!--h3 header, 3rd biggest, size set in style.css, this is bolded as indicated by the ** ** around the words -->

<table class="image" align="left">
<caption align="bottom">Ancestral character reconstruction. Blue: bee syndrome Red: hummingbird syndrome.</caption>
<tr><td><img src="images/crownML.B1.asr.jpg" align="left" width="225" height="225" style="padding: 10px"></td></tr>
</table>

<!-- image +caption being set as discussed above -->

Hummingbird-adapted flowers have evolved a surprising number of times in separate bee-adapted lineages! This suggest the "hummingbird syndrome" strategy is often favored by selection and is genetically accessible to populations. Does standing variation or gene flow act as a source of adaptive alleles? In theory, adaptive introgression could bypass the waiting times for relevant *de novo* mutations. We are using whole genome resequencing and phylogenomic approaches to address whether hummingbird-adapted species share a history of introgression in genome regions that specify floral traits.

### **What is the genetic architecture of complex traits?**

A critical goal of evolutionary genetics is to characterize the types of mutations that contribute to adaptive trait variation. We are using QTL mapping to examine the genetic basis of repeated shifts to hummingbird pollination using replicate mapping populations. What components of parallel phenotypic evolution occur through similar genetic changes?

In addition, we are studying the ecological function and genetic basis of ***personate flowers*** within *Penstemon*, using field studies and QTL mapping. Personate flowers are dorso-ventrally flattened, impeding pollinator visitation relative to open tubular flowers. Personate flowers have arisen at least twice within *Penstemon*, suggesting they have adaptive significance. However, little is known about how and why this interesting flower shape has evolved!

### **How do complex adaptations arise within populations? How are they maintained in the face of gene flow?**

Evolutionary change in complex traits begins with local adaptation within populations. A major challenge is understanding how complex trait differences are maintained in recently diverged taxa that experience gene flow. We are using population genomic approaches to examine the heritability of complex adaptations within populations and to determine the consequences of gene flow on species differentiation. We are focused on recently diverged pairs of sister species that differ in floral syndrome and show evidence of gene flow where species ranges overlap.

### **The effects of mating system on adaptation**

<table class="image" align="left">
<tr><td><img src="images/modeling.jpg" align="right" height="225" style="padding: 10px"></td></tr>
</table>

Mating system has fundamental effects on the genetics of populations, including the fate of new beneficial alleles. Adaptation to a new pollinator may alter patterns of pollen dispersal within and among populations, with effects on population isolation, local adaptation, and the occurrence of hybridization. We are studying the consequences of pollination system on mating events and population structure, which may have relevance for macroevolutionary dynamics.

### Maintenance of variation within populations

We are also using Penstemon species to study the genetic and ecological mechanisms for floral variation within (and across) populations.
