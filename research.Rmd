# Current Research

Our research investigates how genetic and ecological processes at the population level contribute to larger patterns and trends in complex trait evolution, specifically parallel evolution. Currently we are exploring these issues in *Penstemon*, an emerging model system for floral evolution.

*Penstemon* is a large North American plant genus that is ancestrally adapted to bee pollination. Flowers adapted to hummingbird pollination have repeatedly evolved (an estimated 15-20 times!) through complex change to multiple floral traits, with little evidence of evolutionary reversals back to bee syndrome. Recent macroevolutionary analyses suggest hummingbird syndrome is associated with reduced diversification rate within *Penstemon*.

This impressive parallel evolution in a complex trait makes *Penstemon* a fantastic comparative system to study a variety of questions above and below the species level. We study these questions using a variety of approaches: population genomics, QTL mapping, quantitative genetics, comparative studies, phylogenetics, and modeling approaches.

### **What is the source of genetic variation for repeated evolution in a complex trait?**

Our best estimate of the species tree suggests hummingbird syndrome has evolved many independent times. Perhaps this makes this trait highly genetically "accessible" in *Penstemon*. 

What are the relative roles of *de novo* mutations, introgression, and/or ancestral polymorphism in the repeated evolution of hummingbird syndrome traits?

Data from an initial cross suggest relatively few QTLs of major effect underlie the evolution of hummingbird syndrome in this case. Are the genetic architectures and/or QTL positions similar across independent origins of hummingbird adaptation?

### **Effects of trait evolution on mating system and vice versa**

Recent modeling work suggests that reproductive features of populations can influence pollinator transitions. Specifically, the capacity for delayed selfing broadens the conditions where transitioning to a new pollinator such as hummingbirds is favored. This predicts transitions to hummingbird pollination may occur more frequently in self-compatible lineages.

On the flip side, does pollination by hummingbirds vs. bees impact mating system in terms of mate diversity and frequency of self-fertilization? This would affect the structure of genetic diversity within populations and may be relevant for macroevolutionary dynamics.
