<!-- this styles the head element of the wesbite and is incorporated through the .yml, the code itself makes the shortcut icon (aka the favicon) be an image of type .png that can be found within the local folder images under the name eatonii.png
IMP: if you want to change this, make sure to save the image you want to change it to as a png, apparently this is better for favicons because they are so small usually -->
