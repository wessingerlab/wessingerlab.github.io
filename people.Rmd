<!--hello, this is an html comment--> 
<!--the title here NORMALLY controls the big text at the top of this webpage as well as the title shown within the tab but I changed that so this title only controls the text within the tab for all .Rmds/.htmls (the change is coded within the in_header.html) because I wanted the information in the tab to say something different than the text at the top of each webpage--> 
<br>
<!-- anything within carrots is html code that will by knitted into the .html output my knitting the .rmd-->
<!-- br means break and inserts an empty line, i think the size of the break is based on the default size of the body text-->

# Lab Members
<!-- header 1, aka the large font that is centered at the top of the webpage, best to leave a line between headers and other code, otherwise sometimes rmd won't format them correctly -->


<!--the code below indicates this is a code block containing code (within the ```) in the language css and we don't want this code to be echoed onto the website (echo=F)-->
<!--note: no coments can be made within the code block bc rmd is weird so all comments will be below the block and will occur below a comment out version of the thing excatly as it appears within the block,--> 
```{css, echo=FALSE}
img {
    width:  400px;
    height: 400px;
    padding: 10px;
    object-fit: cover;
}
```
<!-- img { -->
<!--     width:  400px; -->
<!--     height: 400px; -->
<!--     padding: 10px; -->
<!--     object-fit: cover; -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- in this css code block the images called within the rest of this webpage (with the html tag "img") are formatted to all be the same size (height:400px; and width:400px; means a square with a height and width of 400 pixels each) with 10 pixels of padding around it (padding: 10px; keeps from the text being too close to it)
object-fit: cover; defines how the actual image fits within the image container that is made by the height, width and padding commands above), this ensures that if the raw image is bigger or smaller than the set hieght and width, it will be resized to take up all available space while maintaining the right aspect ratio, if you don't like how one of the images looks here DO NOT CHANGE THIS instead crop the image differently -->

<!-- 4 hastages mean this is a header of size h4, the fourth biggest (size set in style.css), this size is currently consistent for all people's names within this page-->
###### aka **Carrie**
<!-- 6 hastages mean this is a header of size h6, the fourth biggest (size set in style.css)-->

Carrie started her lab at the University of South Carolina in the Spring of 2020. She is interested in examining microevolutionary processes that drive trait evolution and larger evolutionary patterns. Currently, she is working to study floral adaptation in the plant genus Penstemon using a genetic approach. Many projects are in collaboration with the [Hileman Lab](http://www.hilemanlab.org/) and the [Kelly Lab](http://eeb.ku.edu/sites/eeb.ku.edu/files/files/jkk/index.html) at the University of Kansas. She began this research during my PhD in the [Rausher Lab](http://people.duke.edu/~mrausher/) at Duke University.

#### Josh Stevens
<!-- 4 hastages mean this is a header of size h4, the fourth biggest (size set in style.css), this size is currently consistent for all people's names within this page-->

Josh obtained his undergraduate degree at Keene State College and is now a PhD student at the University of South Carolina. Josh's research focuses on gene flow and mating patterns within various species of Penstemon. He is broadly interested in evolutionary ecology & bioinformatics. He enjoys hiking, kayaking, and exploring new areas. Josh joined the Wessinger lab in the fall of 2020. 

Josh says this picture of his puppy is a good representation of who he is as a person.

#### Trinity Depatie

Trinity is a PhD student at the University of South Carolina focusing on the evolution of morphological floral traits in the Eastern Clade of the genus Penstemon. Trinity has broad interests in floral evolution, ecology, and genetics. She obtained her undergraduate degree at Florida Atlantic University’s Wilkes Honors College and later joined the Wessinger lab in the fall of 2020. Outside of the lab Trinity enjoys running and riding horses.

#### Ashley Hamilton


Ashley is a lab technician who graduated with a BS in Biology from Texas A&M University- Corpus Christi in Fall 2019. She was originally planning on pursuing marine biology but fell in love with plants and plant evolution during a class on research methodology in the rainforests of Costa Rica. Since then, she has pursued these avenues of research passionately, conducting research on a variety of organsims from limpets to seagrass. Currently, she working on several projects in the Wessinger Lab including analyzing morphological traits and geographic varaibles to try to understand underlying evolutionary processes at both the population and species level within *Penstemon*.
