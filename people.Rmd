#### Carolyn Wessinger 
###### aka **Carrie**

I'm examining microevolutionary processes that drive trait evolution and larger evolutionary patterns. I study floral adaptation in the plant genus Penstemon using a genetic approach. Many projects are in collaboration with the [Hileman Lab](http://www.hilemanlab.org/) and the [Kelly Lab](http://eeb.ku.edu/sites/eeb.ku.edu/files/files/jkk/index.html) at the University of Kansas. I began this research during my PhD in the [Rausher Lab](http://people.duke.edu/~mrausher/) at Duke University.

Ashley is a lab technician who graduated with a BS in Biology from Texas A&M University- Corpus Christi in Fall 2019. She was originally planning on pursuing marine biology but fell in love with plants and plant evolution during a class on research methodology in the rainforests of Costa Rica. Since then, she has pursued these avenues of research passionately, conducting research on seagrass genetic diversity under Dr. Patrick Larkin and limpet biogeography under Dr. Chris Bird as well as participating in an REU looking at landscape genetics of prairie plants under Dr. Mitch Cruzan at Portland State University and another REU under Dr. Stacey Smith at the University of Colorado at Boulder investigating potential carotenoid genes associated with flower color variation in Petunieae. Currently, she working in the Wessinger Lab to understand the effect of variable herkogamy on outcrossing rates within a population of *Penstemon cobaea*. She enjoys spending her spare time rock climbing, reading, wildflower hunting, and hiking.
