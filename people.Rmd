#### Carolyn Wessinger 
###### aka **Carrie**

I'm examining microevolutionary processes that drive trait evolution and larger evolutionary patterns. I study floral adaptation in the plant genus Penstemon using a genetic approach. Many projects are in collaboration with the [Hileman Lab](http://www.hilemanlab.org/) and the [Kelly Lab](http://eeb.ku.edu/sites/eeb.ku.edu/files/files/jkk/index.html) at the University of Kansas. I began this research during my PhD in the [Rausher Lab](http://people.duke.edu/~mrausher/) at Duke University.
